# Enterprise Notes

This repo is a collection of my writing on **enterprise IT systems** where traditional endpoint management meets cloud identity and AI.

Topics include:
- **Intune & Entra ID**: modern device and identity management
- **Enterprise IT strategy**: targeting, governance, and scale
- **AI & automation**: practical use of Copilot, ChatGPT, and workflow design

The goal is not just to document technology, but to share **systems-first perspectives** that make enterprise IT work at scale.

Posts here are also cross-published on LinkedIn.
